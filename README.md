## Notes
- Hard levels should contain hybrid levels utilizing multiple mechanics.
- Hard should be the last island considering it's by far more difficult compared to every other island
- After medium, allowing the player visit the gimick levels (`EFGH`) should be fine as the gimick areas aren't too hard. At least not compared to the 'hard' area
